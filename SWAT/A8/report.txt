2.1
*************
The reason for the failure is that the program gets stuck in an infinite loop.
Specifically it keeps trying to re-order two of the same numbers. It finds that
one is greater than or equal to the other, so it swaps the order. However, the next
time through the list this same condition is true, so it swaps the entries again, and
so on.

*************
2.2
*************
The sort function will fail as long as there are 2 of the same number in the input. I
validated this with my own simple test input file.

mysort will fail on any input list that has 2 or more of the same integer.

2.3
*************
Line 89 of mysort.c is the root of this problem. Here the data of 2 Links are checked.
The current condition is whether one integer is greater than or equal to another. However
the proper condition should be strictly greater than. Only in this scenario will the Links
have to be swapped. I validated this by creating my own version of mysort that tested 
only for strictly greater than and the sorting was successful.

On line 89 of mysort.c, remove the '=' from the condition.
