""" Assignment 2 - Basic Image Input / Output / Simple Functionality

This file has a number of functions that you need to fill out in order to
complete the assignment. Please write the appropriate code, following the
instructions on which functions you may or may not use.

GENERAL RULES:
    1. DO NOT INCLUDE code that saves, shows, displays, writes the image that
    you are being passed in. Do that on your own if you need to save the images
    but the functions should NOT save the image to file. (This is a problem
    for us when grading because running 200 files results a lot of images being
    saved to file and opened in dialogs, which is not ideal). Thanks.

    2. DO NOT import any other libraries aside from the three libraries that we
    provide. You may not import anything else, you should be able to complete
    the assignment with the given libraries (and in most cases without them).

    3. DO NOT change the format of this file. Do not put functions into classes,
    or your own infrastructure. This makes grading very difficult for us. Please
    only write code in the allotted region.

def numberOfPixels(image):
    """ This function returns the number of pixels in a grayscale image.

    Note: A grayscale image has one dimension as covered in the lectures. You
    DO NOT have to account for a color image.

    You may use any / all functions to obtain the number of pixels in the image.

    Args:
        image (numpy.ndarray): A grayscale image represented in a numpy array.

    Returns:
        int: The number of pixels in an image.

    """ This function returns the average color value of a grayscale image.

    Assignment Instructions: In order to obtain the average pixel, add up all
    the pixels in the image, and divide by the total number of pixels. We advise
    that you use the function you wrote above to obtain the number of pixels!

    You may not use numpy.mean or numpy.average. All other functions are fair
    game.

    Args:
        image (numpy.ndarray): A grayscale image represented in a numpy array.

    Assignment Instructions: Iterate through every pixel in the image. If the
    pixel is strictly greater than 128, set the pixel to 255. Otherwise, set the
    pixel to 0. You are essentially converting the input into a 1-bit image, as 
    we discussed in lecture, it is a 2-color image.

    You may NOT use any thresholding functions provided by OpenCV to do this.
    All other functions are fair game.

    images on a per pixel basis and dividing them by two.

    Note: You may assume image1 and image2 are the SAME size.

def flipHorizontal(image):

    Assignment Instructions: Given an input image, flip the image on the
