# HW 1: DieN

Note: 
If you read the homework, I haven't specified how you need to submit the homework. I will give out those instructions by Monday. However you are welcome to start thinking about the homework and working on it.

Problem:
The game DieN is played in the following way.
 
Consider a die with N sides (where N is an integer greater than 1) and a nonempty set B of integers between 1 and N (inclusive). The rules of the game are:
 
 1. You start with 0 dollars.
 2. Roll an N-sided die with a different number from 1 to N printed on each
 side.
   - If you roll a number not in B, you receive that many dollars. (E.g., if
   you roll the number 2 and 2 is not in B, then you receive 2 dollars.)
   - If you roll a number in B, then you lose all of your obtained money and
   the game ends.
 3. After you roll the die (and don't roll a number in B), you have the option
 to quit the game. If you quit, you keep all the money you've earned to that
 point. If you continue to roll, go back to step 2.
 
For this problem, determine an optimal policy for playing the game DieN with N = 30 and B = {n: 1 <= n <= 30 and n is not prime}. (The policy should depend on your current bankroll.)
 
What is the expected value of this game if you follow an optimal policy?
