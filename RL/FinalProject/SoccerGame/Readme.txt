1 - Original (all data, including zeros) learning rate = 0.05, init Q = 0.0, epsilon = 0.5
2 - Cleaned (only nonzero data points)
3 - Cleaned, decayed learning rate (decay rate = 0.99, init learning rate = 0.5, init Q = -100)

Foe
2 - Cleaned, learning rate = 0.05, init Q = -100.0, epsilon = 0.5   NOTE: With init Q = 0.0, didn't get any change
3 - Cleaned, decayed learning rate (decay rate = 0.99, init learning rate = 0.5, init Q = -100)
