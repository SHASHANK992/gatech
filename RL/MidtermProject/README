To build and run on Windows:

javac -cp ../lib/*;. BoundedRandomWalk.java
java -cp ../lib/*;. BoundedRandomWalk

Make sure you have the Java Development kit (JDK) installed.
Used Burlap v 2.0


The current implementation for Experiment 1 DOES NOT WORK. The critiqueAndUpdate method is not
updating the state values. The data I used in my report was from an implementation more like
Experiment2 than what is currently in place.
