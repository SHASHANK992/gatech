To run the code, place all the files in a directory, create a folder in that directory called "orders", and type:

python KNNTrader.py


Please note that to run with IBM data you must change the variable
'syms' in the main function. The line is currently commented out, so 
you will just have to uncomment it.

Also note: __init__.py could not be uploaded into t-square, so that will need to be added to run here
