Instructor notes on solving this problem

1. Read CSV orders file
   - look in symbols column to see all the symbols you want to read
   - get start and end dates from this as well
2. Read adjusted closing for relevant stocks
3. Add column to prices df for cash
    - Make this all ones for easy use later
4. Make new data frame for trades
    - Stores deltas in holdings
    - Go line by line through orders file and fill in 
    - Not tallying just yet
5. New data frame for holdings
    - On each day, what the actual holdings for stocks and cash
    - Init with just cash
    - take previous line and add data from corresponding trades file
6. New data frame for value
    - holdings times prices
    - (why we made cash column in prices all ones)
7. Daily portfolio value is then the sum of each row
